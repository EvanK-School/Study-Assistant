## What is Study-Assistant?

Study assistant is meant to be a **Python** library for analyzing and studying
notes and definitions. Study assistant is intended to be used for plain text
notes (working with _Markdown_) using comments to mark anything that is important
for later studying. More detailed markings can be made in a separate document,
and linked into the main notes document, for ease of use (see [documentation][1] for
details).
